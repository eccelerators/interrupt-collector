Interrupt-Collector by Eccelerators
===================================

**Introduction**
----------------

The *Interrupt-Collector*, offered by Eccelerators, is a key IP block (Intellectual Property Block) in microelectronics. 
Its main role is to aggregate interrupts from diverse sources and route them to the interrupt input of a CPU (Central Processing Unit) 
or a multiprocessor system. This functionality is crucial in complex environments where numerous devices or 
processes operate simultaneously, necessitating the CPU's attention.

**Functionality**
-----------------

The distinctiveness of the Interrupt-Collector is evident in the type of interrupt sources it can manage. 
It is specifically designed for level-triggered interrupt sources, meaning the interrupt stays active as long as 
the trigger event or signal condition persists. This is in contrast to edge-triggered sources, which initiate an 
interrupt due to a change in the signal state, like transitioning from low to high or vice versa.

**Compatibility with Edge-Triggered Sources**
----------------------------------------------

For systems employing edge-triggered sources, Eccelerators presents an additional solution â€“ the *Event-Catcher*. 
This IP block is capable of transforming edge-triggered sources into level-triggered sources, thereby ensuring 
compatibility with the Interrupt-Collector. This versatility is crucial for integrating a wide range of source types 
and signal variations into a cohesive system.

**Conclusion**
---------------

Overall, the Interrupt-Collector is a testament to the advanced technological 
strides in the realm of computer hardware, pivotal in crafting more efficient and adaptable 
computing systems. Such innovations are integral to the evolution of high-performance computing 
environments, particularly in sectors like server infrastructures, embedded systems, and intricate data processing units.
